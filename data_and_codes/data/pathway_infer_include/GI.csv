WBInteraction000524143,Genetic,Unilateral_suppression,lin-15(e1763) mutant animals display a 54% penetrance of P11 to P12 fate transformation (Table 1A). However lin-15 acts in a signal dependent manner as loss of LIN-3 activity removes its effect on P11 and P12 cells. lin-3(n378/n1059) mutants do not display a P11/P12 defect (Table 2)_ neither do lin-3(n378/n1059); lin-15(e1763) double mutant animals (n=45).
